                <dl>Nobody cares about you. You are the only person who can take care of you and only person who know you better, so make your priority list and put yourself at the top.</dl>
                <dl>I would do things without thinking, without an iota of doubt in my mind if it was the right thing to do. Going on unplanned trips alone. Breaking old friendships. I had this insatiable urge to do things without a second thought.</dl>
                <dl>My mind would weave stories and daydream but I would do nothing except stare. It's been 2 years and only one thing has stuck by me throughout.</dl>
